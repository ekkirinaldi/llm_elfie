Elfie.co is a global healthcare digital company focused on revolutionising wellness solutions to enhance individual health outcomes. Our vision is to provide a holistic and gamified solution to monitor general health and chronic diseases, the silent killers of our generation.
Each year, 25% of all people die from a chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, angina, asthma…). So much of that could be avoided if people were aware of their condition and followed their doctor's prescription and lifestyle recommendations. Unfortunately, they don’t due to a lack of awareness of danger, unwillingness to change lifestyle,  and costs to follow treatment (lifelong).

Elfie is a disruptive disease prevention and management application that gamified self-monitoring and supports patients worldwide with AI-driven coaching. It is promoted by 10,000s of doctors and endorsed by multiple healthcare leaders worldwide.

In collaboration with Willis Towers Watson, a renowned global advisory, broking, and solutions company, we are embarking on an exciting venture to establish a thriving business in the field of wellness. Together with WTW, we will create a unique solution, ElfieWorks, available exclusively to WTW clients and partners that will leverage the full spectrum of WTW expertise and assets combined with a premium version of Elfie that will include the best in breed of available technology and gamification.

With every interaction on the app, the firm offers “Elfie coins,”  which give users access to gift cards, discounts, as well as free products and services.
Founded in 2020 by Ofir Ejnes and Jean-Francois Legourd, Elfie said that its system has already been approved by multiple medical associations worldwide. Since its establishment, Elfie has expanded to Brazil and Vietnam.
Last year, the firm raised US$1 million in pre-seed funding from FEBE Ventures.
